Serious WIP

Hey Jan,

Regarding the pitch to JL and Con for a sports video analytics product I am in two minds. I think the two of us would make a very strong founding team if we are left to plot our own course. That makes me very excited.   

The climbing idea. This idea in hindsight is possibly not the greatest and not one that could attract funding in it's current form. I am still going to complete it (been leaving it alone for a while) but more as a passion project than as a potential company. That means I should re-look at the arena of potential sports. 


Advantages:
- They seem to have connections to the sporting worlds of Golf and Rugby which are both large enough sports to build a business around.
- Funding - cash to keep going and get a larger team and equipment (colab is a luss).
- Use their marketing and sales experience.


Disadvantages:
- It will take at least 12 months to get a decent product that one would pay for. 
- I am unsure they have the patience for it.
- Lose equity (I am not too bothered about this).
- I don't want to get pulled into their other "MVP's".

My other consideration is I am rather set on moving to another country. I have only started sending out my CV and I don't know how viable that option is yet. Obviously, moving does not necessarily mean I could not contribute to the company here but it will make it more difficult. 

Lastly, I really enjoy working on projects that are not "work" and perhaps a viable approach is to partner with a golf, rugby or squash club and
